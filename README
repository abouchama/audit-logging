For many secured environments there's a requirement to log every user management action.
The idea is to have an Audit logging module, that allow the production service, to have a trace for all administrative tasks done in Fuse ESB(servicemix) or karaf over the following channels : (SSH, WebConsole, JMX)

The trace contain the information of the admin or operator user logged, the task realized, channel used, date...etc

Example of trace:

command = list
event.topics = org/apache/felix/service/command/EXECUTING
event.subject = Subject:
 Principal: UserPrincipal[karaf]
]
